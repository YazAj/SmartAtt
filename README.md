# AttendAI

AttendAI is a responsive university attendance management web platform for the graduation project **Smart Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition**.

Sprint 1 establishes the buildable foundation only: Clean Architecture, ASP.NET Core Identity, role dashboards, localization, RTL/LTR support, light/dark/system themes, database foundation, tests, documentation, and a face-recognition technical spike. Academic management CRUD and production attendance workflows are intentionally out of scope.

## Current Sprint Status

Sprint 1 is closed as completed for the application foundation. The solution builds, automated tests pass, formatting passes, SQL Server LocalDB migration was applied, runtime authentication was verified, and desktop/mobile English/Arabic light/dark screenshots were checked. Real face-recognition runtime remains a documented technical gate before production Face Enrollment because no approved biometric samples or selected model dependencies are committed.

## Technology Stack

- .NET 8, ASP.NET Core 8 MVC, Razor Views
- ASP.NET Core Identity with cookie authentication
- Entity Framework Core with SQL Server provider
- Bootstrap 5, CSS custom properties, JavaScript
- Built-in localization for `en-US` and `ar-JO`
- xUnit, ASP.NET Core integration testing, SQLite in-memory test database

## Architecture Summary

```text
src/AttendAI.Domain          Core domain abstractions and enums
src/AttendAI.Application     Contracts, role routing, safe redirects, face engine abstraction
src/AttendAI.Infrastructure  EF Core, Identity persistence, seeding, fake face engine
src/AttendAI.Web             MVC controllers, Razor views, localization, theming, UI
tests/                       Unit and integration tests
experiments/                 Face-recognition POC console harness
docs/                        Sprint 1 documentation
```

Dependencies point inward: Web uses Infrastructure and Application; Infrastructure uses Application and Domain; Application uses Domain; Domain has no framework dependency.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK `8.0.423` or compatible .NET 8 SDK
- SQL Server LocalDB or SQL Server for local development
- Optional: approved local face images for manual POC verification

Restore local tools and packages:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
dotnet restore AttendAI.sln
```

## Database Setup

The default development connection string targets LocalDB:

```json
"Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=AttendAI;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
```

Override it with User Secrets or environment variables for local machines:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=AttendAI;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True" --project src/AttendAI.Web
```

Apply migrations:

```bash
dotnet tool run dotnet-ef database update --project src/AttendAI.Infrastructure --startup-project src/AttendAI.Web --context ApplicationDbContext
```

## Demo Admin Setup

Roles are seeded by the application initializer. A demo administrator is created only when configured through User Secrets or environment variables:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "DemoAdmin:Email" "admin@example.edu" --project src/AttendAI.Web
dotnet user-secrets set "DemoAdmin:Password" "<generate-a-strong-local-password>" --project src/AttendAI.Web
dotnet user-secrets set "DemoAdmin:FullName" "Demo Administrator" --project src/AttendAI.Web
```

Do not commit real credentials.

## Run

```bash
dotnet run --project src/AttendAI.Web
```

The first non-test startup applies migrations and seeds Identity roles. Use the HTTPS URL printed by ASP.NET Core.

## Tests and Quality

```bash
dotnet restore AttendAI.sln
dotnet build AttendAI.sln
dotnet test AttendAI.sln
dotnet format AttendAI.sln --verify-no-changes
```

## Localization

Supported cultures:

- `en-US`
- `ar-JO`

Use the language selector in the top bar. The selected culture is persisted in the ASP.NET Core culture cookie. Arabic renders with `dir="rtl"` and English with `dir="ltr"`.

## Theme System

The theme toggle cycles through:

- System preference
- Light
- Dark

The preference is stored in `localStorage` as `attendai-theme`, and the layout applies it before CSS loads to reduce theme flashing.

## Face POC

The production app depends only on `IFaceRecognitionEngine`. Sprint 1 includes a deterministic fake engine and a console harness:

```bash
dotnet run --project experiments/AttendAI.FaceRecognition.Poc -- <image-path>
dotnet run --project experiments/AttendAI.FaceRecognition.Poc -- <reference-image-path> <probe-image-path>
```

No personal biometric images are committed. To test negative fake-engine paths, use a local file containing `NO_FACE` or `MULTI_FACE`. Real engine verification remains pending until approved samples and native dependencies are supplied locally.

## Sprint 1 Closure Evidence

- SQL Server LocalDB verification database: `AttendAI_Sprint1Closure_20260722`.
- Migration applied: `20260722120650_InitialIdentityFoundation`.
- Runtime pages verified with Edge/Playwright against `https://localhost:7052`.
- Role logins verified for Admin, Instructor, and Student verification users.
- Dark/light and English/Arabic RTL/LTR screenshots captured under ignored `logs/ui-verification/`.
- Secret scan found no non-ignored credentials, private keys, SDK licenses, biometric samples, or model files.

## Known Limitations

- No public self-registration.
- No student, instructor, course, section, classroom, or enrollment CRUD.
- No lecture sessions, attendance registration, reports, exports, liveness detection, or production face enrollment.
- Real face recognition was evaluated and documented, but not executed with biometric samples in Sprint 1.

## Future Sprint Summary

Sprint 2 can begin academic setup and administrator-created user workflows after Sprint 1 acceptance. Do not add attendance registration or production biometric flows before the academic foundation is ready.
